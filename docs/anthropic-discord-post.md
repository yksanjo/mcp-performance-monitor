• 🔍 Server comparison tools
• 📈 Usage pattern analysis
• 🚨 Alerting for performance issues

**Quick Start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-performance-monitor.git
cd mcp-performance-monitor
npm run install:all
npm run db:seed
npm run start:demo
```

**Live Demo:** http://localhost:5173 (when running locally)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-performance-monitor

Built specifically for the Claude/MCP ecosystem. Would love feedback from the community! 🙏

### Option 2: Detailed Technical Version

```
## 🚀 **MCP Performance Monitor - Open Source Tool for Claude Developers**

**TL;DR:** Built a comprehensive monitoring and optimization platform for MCP servers that helps developers make data-driven decisions about their Claude workflows.

### **The Problem**
As MCP adoption grows with Claude, developers face challenges:
- No central way to compare MCP server performance
- Hard to track costs across different providers
- Difficult to identify bottlenecks in Claude workflows
- No benchmarks for server selection

### **The Solution**
A complete monitoring system that provides:
- **Real-time dashboards** showing server performance metrics
- **Cost analysis** across MCP providers
- **Comparison tools** to choose the right servers
- **Usage patterns** to optimize deployment
- **Alerting system** for performance issues

### **Key Features**
✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times (p50, p95, p99), success rates, error rates
✅ **Cost Analysis**: Monitor API costs, set budgets, get optimization suggestions  
✅ **Server Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple servers
✅ **Usage Patterns**: Heatmaps, peak hour analysis, operation distribution
✅ **Easy Integration**: Simple monitoring agent that wraps your MCP calls

### **Supported Servers**
Works with all MCP servers, including:
- `filesystem` - `brave-search` - `github` - `sqlite` - `weather`
- `notion` - `discord` - `openai` - And many more...

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone and run demo
git clone https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-performance-monitor.git
cd mcp-performance-monitor
npm run install:all
npm run db:seed
npm run start:demo
```

**Access:**
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:3001
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

### **Why This Matters for Claude Developers**
1. **Choose the fastest servers** for your Claude workflows
2. **Avoid unexpected API costs** with detailed tracking
3. **Identify bottlenecks** before they affect users
4. **Make data-driven decisions** about server selection
5. **Optimize costs** without sacrificing performance

### **Technical Stack**
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + SQLite
- **Monitoring Agent**: TypeScript package for easy integration
- **Deployment**: Docker support included

### **Open Source & Community Driven**

### Option 4: Problem/Solution Format

```
## 🛠️ **Solving a Pain Point: MCP Server Management for Claude**

**Problem I Noticed:** 
As I built more complex Claude applications with MCP, I struggled with:
- Not knowing which servers were performing best
- Getting surprised by API costs
- Debugging performance issues
- Choosing between similar servers

**Solution I Built:**
**MCP Performance Monitor** - An open source tool that gives you:

1. **Visibility**: See real-time performance of all your MCP servers
