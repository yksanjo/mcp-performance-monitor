## 🌐 **STEP 2: REDDIT POST (r/ClaudeAI)**

### Go to: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/submit

**Title:**
```
Built MCP Performance Monitor - Open Source Tool to Track & Optimize Your MCP Servers
```

**Body (copy and paste):**
```
Hey r/ClaudeAI community!

I just built and open-sourced **MCP Performance Monitor** - a tool to help developers track, compare, and optimize their Model Context Protocol servers.

**The Problem:**
As MCP servers become more popular, developers face several challenges:
- No easy way to compare server performance
- Hard to track costs across different providers
- Difficult to identify bottlenecks and issues
- No benchmarks for server selection

**The Solution:**
MCP Performance Monitor provides:
- **Real-time dashboards** showing server performance metrics
- **Cost tracking** across different MCP providers
- **Usage pattern analysis** to optimize deployment
- **Comparison tools** to choose the right servers
- **Alerting system** for performance issues

**Quick Start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-performance-monitor.git
cd mcp-performance-monitor
npm run install:all
npm run db:seed
npm run start:demo
```
Open: http://localhost:5173

**GitHub:** https://github.com/yksanjo/mcp-performance-monitor

**Why this matters for Claude developers:**
- Choose the fastest servers for your workflows
- Avoid unexpected API costs
- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- Make data-driven decisions about server selection

Would love your feedback and what features would be most useful for your MCP workflows!
```
